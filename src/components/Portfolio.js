            <p>Since starting Codeclan, my cohort and I have already completed several small-scale projects. Some have developed
                from homework and lab exercises in class, while others have been started as a solo project in their own right.
                To date, my list includes:</p>
            </div>
            <div className="portfolio-content">
            </div>
        </div>

     );
}
 
export default Portfolio;
